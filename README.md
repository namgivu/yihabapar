Intro
=====
This project contains often-used Python utilities during my work 
as web developer such as git clone, run bash command, command line argument parser, etc.

The Context
===========
In which situation we may use the utilities in this project?

We are working on Python project and need a command e.g. to run a bash command form Python code
the same way we run it from command line.

- Create a sub folder in your project e.g. `$APP_HOME/util`; we call this `$UTIL_HOME`
- Download this project to `$UTIL_HOME` via running below [let-me-in.sh](https://github.com/namgivu/yihabapar/blob/master/let-me-in.sh) script - please edit `$UTIL_HOME` before you run it
```
$ let-me-in.sh

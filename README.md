Intro
=====
This project contains often-used Python utilities during my work 
as web developer such as git clone, run bash command, command line argument parser, etc.

The Context

In which situation we may use the utilities in this project?

We are working on Python project and need a command e.g. to run a bash command form Python code
the same way we run it from command line.

- Download this project to `$UTIL_HOME` via running below 
[let-me-in.sh](https://github.com/namgivu/yihabapar/blob/master/let-me-in.sh) script - 
please edit `$UTIL_HOME` before you run it
```
$ let-me-in.sh
```
